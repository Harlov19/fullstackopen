# Exercise 0.5 â€“ Loading the Single-Page App

This sequence diagram shows what happens when a user opens the single-page app (SPA) version of the notes app. It illustrates the flow of events between the browser executing JavaScript and the server, including how the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and existing notes are fetched and rendered dynamically.

You can try the live SPA app here: [SPA Notes app](https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa)
